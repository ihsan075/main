                            <div class="col-xs-12">
                                <p>The Riley Nine was one of the most successful light cars produced by the British motor industry
                                    in the inter war period. It was made by the Riley company of Coventry, England with a wide range
                                    of body styles between 1926 and 1938.</p>

                                <p>The car was largely designed by two of the Riley brothers, Percy and Stanley. Stanley was
                                    responsible for the chassis, suspension and body and the older Percy designed the engine.</p>

                                <p>The 1,087 cc four-cylinder engine had hemispherical combustion chambers with the valves
                                    inclined at 45 degrees in a crossflow head. To save the expense and complication of overhead
                                    camshafts, the valves were operated by two camshafts mounted high in the crankcase through short
                                    pushrods and rockers. The engine was mounted in the chassis by a rubber bushed bar that ran
                                    through the block with a further mount at the rear of the gearbox. Drive was to the rear wheels
                                    through a torque tube and spiral bevel live rear axle mounted on semi elliptic springs.</p>

                            <div class="col-xs-12">
                                <p>The Pontiac Chieftain is an automobile that was produced by the Pontiac from 1949 to 1958.
                                    Chieftains were one of the first all new car designs to come to Pontiac in the post
                                    World War II years. Previous cars had been 1942 models with minor revisions.</p>

                                <p>The Chieftain was initially introduced with four models: Sedan, Sedan Coupe, Business Coupe
                                    and Deluxe Convertible Coupe. In 1950, a Catalina Coupe was added to the range while a station
                                    wagon was added in 1952, with the demise of the top of the line Streamliner wagon.</p>

                                <p>Some of the more interesting optional items available for the first generation Chieftain
                                    included a radio with seven vacuum tubes, tissue dispenser, under seat heaters, and a Remington
                                    Auto-Home shaver. In 1951, the horsepower on the 8-cylinder rose to 116. The Chieftain came with
                                    a gas gauge, ammeter, oil pressure gauge, and a temperature gauge which had marks for 160, 180,
                                    and 220 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

                            <div class="col-xs-12">
                                <p>The Continental Mark II is a personal luxury car that was produced by Continental in 1956
                                    and 1957. An attempt to build a post-World War II car to rival the greatest of the pre-War
                                    era, or anything produced in Europe, it is regarded as a rare and elegant classic.</p>

                                <p>Ford wanted a superior and standalone up-market brand – aside from Lincoln – to compete
                                    with General Motors' Cadillac, Packard, and Chrysler Corporation's Imperial brands.</p>

                                <p>The new Continental was not intended to be the largest or most powerful automobile; rather,
                                    the most luxurious and elegant American car available, designed to recapture the spirit of
                                    the great classics of the prewar period—with prices to match. The Mark II's inspiration
                                    was the celebrated V12-powered Lincoln Continental of the 1940s, among the most notable cars
                                    of that War-interrupted decade.</p>

                            <div class="col-xs-12">
                                <p>The Hudson Motor Car Company made Hudson and other brand automobiles in Detroit, Michigan,
                                    from 1909 to 1954. In 1954, Hudson merged with Nash-Kelvinator Corporation to form American
                                    Motors (AMC). The Hudson name was continued through the 1957 model year, after which it
                                    was discontinued.</p>

                                <p>The company had a number of firsts for the auto industry; these included dual brakes, the
                                    use of dashboard oil-pressure and generator warning lights, and the first balanced crankshaft,
                                    which allowed the Hudson straight-six engine, dubbed the "Super Six" (1916), to work at
                                    a higher rotational speed while remaining smooth, developing more power for its size than
                                    lower-speed engines. The dual brake system used a secondary mechanical emergency brake system,
                                    which activated the rear brakes when the pedal traveled beyond the normal reach of the primary
                                    system; a mechanical parking brake was also used. Hudson transmissions also used an oil bath
                                    and cork clutch mechanism that proved to be as durable as it was smooth.</p>

                                <p>The Fiat 500 (Italian: Cinquecento) was a city car produced by the Italian manufacturer
                                    Fiat between 1957 and 1975.</p>

                                <p>Launched as the Nuova (new) 500 in July 1957, it was a cheap and practical town car.
                                    Measuring only 2.97 metres (9 feet 9 inches) long, and originally powered by an appropriately
                                    sized 479 cc two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, the 500 redefined the term "small car" and
                                    is considered one of the first city cars.</p>

                                <p>Despite its diminutive size, the 500 proved to be an enormously practical and popular
                                    vehicle throughout Europe. Besides the two-door coupé, it was also available as the
                                    "Giardiniera" station wagon; this variant featured the standard engine laid on its side,
                                    the wheelbase lengthened by 10 cm (3.9 in) to provide a more convenient rear seat,
                                    a full-length sunroof, and larger brakes from the Fiat 600.</p>
